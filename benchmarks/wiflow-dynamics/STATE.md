# Action-Conditioned Dynamics Model — Objective State

Branch: `feat/wiflow-action-conditioned-dynamics` (off RuView `d6407ae0`)

## Objective (chartered — do not silently widen)

Implement an **action-conditioned dynamics model** for WiFi-CSI → pose/occupancy with
trustworthy evaluation on the existing WiFlow-STD benchmark. The gap being filled:
the stack currently has only constant-velocity extrapolation and deterministic
kinematics; neither gives `p(observation | intervention)`, which
information-gain-driven experiment selection requires.

**Explicit NON-goal:** beating SOTA. No number from this work may be reported as
SOTA-beating. This repo has already been burned by exactly that (see Retraction below).

## Framing that must not drift

This is **active sensing / masking on offline data**. The "action" selects which
*already-recorded* coordinates of an observation are revealed to the model. It is
**not** a causal intervention on the world. The dataset is observational; nothing here
licenses a causal claim. State it this way in every write-up.

### Upstream protocol (read from source, not assumed)

- **Split** (`dataset.py:create_preprocessed_train_val_test_loaders`):
  `random.seed(42)`; `random.shuffle(file_indices)` over 500 files; floor(0.7·500)=350
  train / floor(0.15·500)=75 val / remaining 75 test. Each file = 720 windows →
  test = 54,000. **File-level split, not window-level.**
- **PCK** (`utils/metrics.py:calculate_pck`): torso norm =
  `‖target[:,2] − target[:,12]‖` (NECK_IDX=2, PELVIS_IDX=12 on the 15-kp convention),
  `clamp(min=0.01)`; `dist = ‖pred−target‖₂` per keypoint;
  `normalized = dist / norm`; PCK@t = `mean over (batch × keypoints)` of
  `normalized <= t`. Note: a **single flat mean**, not mean-of-per-frame-means.
- **MPJPE**: `mean over (batch × keypoints)` of per-keypoint L2. Normalized image
  units, **not metres**.
- **GT in NPY mode**: `all_keypoints.npy` is already filtered to 15 kp and
  already scaled — `keypoint_scale=1000.0` is applied **only in the CSV fallback
  path**, never in NPY mode. Do not divide again.
- **`enable_temporal_clean=True`** in NPY mode applies `_clean_single_frame_zeros`:
  any keypoint that is exactly (0,0) is replaced by the mean of that frame's
  non-zero keypoints. Per-frame, order-independent → replicable in Rust.
- Corruption: dataset files 487–499 (9,072 windows, 2.52%) carry NaN + amplitudes
  to 3.4e38. Masks committed at `results/nan_windows_mask.npy`,
  `results/big_windows_mask.npy`.

### The retraction this work must not repeat

An earlier "92.9% PCK@20" was **retracted**: the trainer's `pck()` used an absolute
0.2-image-unit threshold (NOT torso-normalized) and the model emitted a **constant
pose** (pred std 0.0000). A mean predictor scores 100% under that broken protocol.
True torso-normalized value: 19.1%. Any evaluation path that can score high with a
constant output is a defect.

## Charter discrepancy found (report to lead — NOT charter-invalidating)

The charter states measurement (b) is `BLOCKED-ON-DATA` with only 1,077 paired
windows. **`RESULTS.md` says otherwise:** a 2026-06-10 22:10–22:40 session collected
**2,046 paired windows** (`~/wiflow-std-bench/paired-20260610.jsonl`, 34 MB, present
on disk) and measurement (b) was **completed and measured** (`results/measurement_b.json`).
Its verdict: *no run beats the mean-pose baseline* (mean-pose 95.9% torso-PCK@20 vs
best fine-tune 65.0%) — fine-tuning transfers as optimization aid only, not feature
transfer.

Operational effect: **none**. The charter's real constraint — never touch/upload real
CSI person data — is unchanged and still binding. This work stays entirely on the
public Kaggle WiFlow dataset. Recording the discrepancy so the ledger is accurate.

## Hard constraints (binding)

- **Privacy (ADR-299):** real CSI at `RuView/data/recordings/*.csi.jsonl` and
  `RuView/v2/data/recordings/` is person data. Never upload to a rented host, never
  git-add, never allowlist to silence the guard. Only the public Kaggle dataset may
  leave this box. `paired-20260610.jsonl` is real capture → same rule.
- **Worktree:** never write into `/home/ruvultra/projects/ruflo` (operator cwd,
  unrelated repo). One writer only, this worktree.
- **Spend:** vast.ai capped at 1 instance / $25 / 6 h with mandatory trap-teardown.
  **DECISION: not renting.** The local RTX 5080 covers this workload; renting adds
  teardown and credential risk for zero upside. Revisit only if a measured local
  run proves infeasible.
- **Rust, not Python,** for new model/training components. Existing Python benchmark
  scripts may be READ and RUN. One narrow exception is taken below, and justified.

## Justified deviation: one Python fixture-generation run

Reproducing the honest baseline requires consuming a PyTorch `.pth` checkpoint and
the upstream `Dataset`/split code, including `file_mappings.pkl` (a Python pickle,
not readable from Rust without reimplementing pickle). Porting the 2.23M-param
Conv1d/Conv2d/axial-attention network to Burn purely to re-derive a number that is
already measured would consume the guards budget for no epistemic gain — and the
ported net is **not needed** for the dynamics model.

Instead: **one Python run that generates fixtures, not models.** It dumps split index
arrays, the reference predictions, and the GT exactly as `calculate_pck` consumes it,
with sha256s. This is fixture generation, not new model/training code — no Rust model
or training logic is written in Python. The Rust harness is then validated two
independent ways against those fixtures. Recording this as a deliberate, bounded
deviation.

## Milestones (guards before capability — non-negotiable order)

- [ ] **M1 — Anti-Goodhart harness.** Torso-normalized PCK matching upstream exactly;
      mean-predictor baseline; constant-pose detector (prediction std across frames
      must be non-degenerate); NaN/corrupt-window masking. Must include a **failing
      test that reproduces the retraction**: near-static GT + constant prediction,
      where the old absolute-0.2 protocol passes and this harness rejects.
- [ ] **M2 — Reproduce the honest baseline** (PCK@20 ≈ 0.9609/0.9661) through the new
      harness. If it cannot be reproduced: STOP and report. Do not proceed to novel
      modelling on an unvalidated harness.
- [ ] **M3 — Action-conditioned dynamics model.** Next-observation prediction
      conditioned on an explicit action (probe/subcarrier/antenna-group selection),
      emitting prediction + **calibrated** uncertainty. Report a proper scoring rule
      and a calibration metric, not just point error.
- [ ] **M4 — Information-gain evaluation.** EIG-driven probe selection vs (a) random
      and (b) fixed probing, on held-out data. Paired, seeded, same budget.
- [ ] **M5 — Lineage/evidence recorded for every claim.**

## Open questions to resolve before M3 design

1. **Are windows temporally ordered within a file?** (`window_info.npz:window_to_frame`,
   `config.npz:stride`). If window i+1 does not follow window i in time, "next-observation
   dynamics" must be redefined — and said so explicitly.
2. **What is the 540-channel layout?** (antennas × subcarriers × amp/phase?) The action
   must select a *semantically meaningful* group (antenna pair, subcarrier band), not
   arbitrary indices.
3. **What is the mean-predictor's torso-PCK@20 on the WiFlow test split?** Unknown.
   On the ESP32 set it was 95.9% because one subject barely moved; across 5 subjects
   it may be far lower. Whatever it is, it is the honesty bar for everything after.

## Reporting rules

Every number states **MEASURED** (by this work, this run, command shown) or **CITED**
(from existing results). Never blurred. A blocked milestone honestly reported is a
success; a green number from a broken protocol is a failure. No claims about "AGI",
"SOTA", or generalization beyond what the measured protocol supports.

## Escalate to operator only for

(a) exceeding the $25 / 6 h / 1-instance caps; (b) anything requiring real-CSI person
data; (c) a finding that invalidates the charter itself.

## Progress log

- **2026-09-08 ~22:15** — Session start. Ground truth verified (table above).
  Worktree + branch created. Charter discrepancy on measurement (b) found and
  recorded. Decision: no vast.ai rental. Next: M1.
